        <ul>MANAGEMENT
            <li>
                At the core, managers work with individuals. Your ability to communicate, interact and lead people can
                be important. The sooner you can build a good relationship with people, the better you can manage them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>SALES
            <li>
                As a departmental or financial manager, you might be responsible for handling a portion of the company's
                budget. This includes tracking income and expenses and calculating the four essential aspects of
                budgeting, like revenue, operating expenses, capital expenses and employee expenses. A manager with
                remarkable budgeting skills could ideally forecast expenses for a year or more in advance. Their job is
                to ensure that the department or company can cover all its costs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>COMMUNICATION
            <li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</li>
            <li>Confident, articulate, and professional speaking abilities</li>
            <li>Empathic listener and persuasive speaker</li>
            <li>Writing creative or factual</li>
            <li>Speaking in public, to groups, or via electronic media</li>
            <li>Excellent presentation and negotiation skills</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>LEADERSHIP
            <li>Communication is one of many important leadership skills examples for your resume. Effective
                communication is essential to present a company’s mission, vision, and goals to employees. Written
                communication skills were the top ranked attribute in NACE’s survey; 82% of employers value these
                skills. Verbal communication skills weren’t far behind; 67% of employers ranked verbal communication
                skills. Convey your communication expertise in your resume by highlighting written and verbal projects
                you contributed to—such as corporate reports, case studies, newsletters, training materials, meetings,
                and public speaking events.</li>
